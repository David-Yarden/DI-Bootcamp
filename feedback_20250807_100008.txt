suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__add__` and `__iadd__` methods return integers when adding Currency objects, but the example outputs show Currency objects.  The return type should be a `Currency` object.
- Exercise 2 is missing.  The instructions ask to create `func.py` and `exercise_one.py` files, but they aren't included in the submitted code.
- In Exercise 1,  the error message in `__add__` and `__iadd__` could be slightly improved for clarity. For example, instead of `<dollar>`, use the actual currency value (like 'dollar').
- Exercise 1 could benefit from input validation in the constructor to handle invalid amounts or currency types. 
- Add docstrings to functions and classes to improve readability and understanding.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `Siamese` class could be enhanced with unique attributes or methods if the exercise had specified any breed-specific characteristics.  As it stands, it simply inherits from `Cat` without adding anything new, which is fine given the instructions.
- In Exercise 2, the `fight` method could include a check for division by zero (if a dog's age is 0).  While the provided examples avoid this, it's good practice to prevent potential errors.
- Exercise 3 could benefit from error handling in the case that `args` is empty when calling `play`.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 3, the `Dog` class is imported from `ExerciseXP`.  It's best practice to avoid ambiguous import paths. Provide the full path if it's in a different directory or consider refactoring to avoid the need for an external import in this exercise.
- In Exercise 4, the `check_majority` method prints 'Person not found' if the person isn't in the list.  Consider returning a boolean value instead for better flexibility in how the caller handles the case of a missing person.
- In both exercises, add docstrings to the classes and methods to enhance readability and explain their purpose and parameters.

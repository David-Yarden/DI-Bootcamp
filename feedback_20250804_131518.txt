suggestions for improvement:
- The `find_oldest_cat` function has a bug: the `return oldest` statement is inside the `for` loop, so it returns after checking only the first cat. It should be outside the loop.
- Add docstrings to the `Cat` class and the `find_oldest_cat` function to improve readability and explain their purpose.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `oldest_cat` instead of `oldest`).

suggestions for improvement:
- The `bark` method's output should be changed to match the instructions: '<dog_name> goes woof!'
- Add a comparison of dog sizes to fulfill Step 4 of Exercise 2.
- Add printing of the name and height for each dog to fulfill Step 3.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Consider adding docstrings to the class and methods for better readability and documentation.
- The use of a `for` loop for printing lyrics is efficient. No performance improvements are immediately apparent.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `sort_animals` method could be slightly improved for efficiency by using a defaultdict instead of checking if the key exists in the dictionary before appending.
- Add docstrings to all methods to improve readability and understanding of the code's functionality.
